## TODO

# How Much Faster?
For very short sleep times, the serial program is faster than the parallelized one. This makes sense because there is overhead associated with starting the parallel program (breaking the task into multiple threads, etc.). If the overhead is greater than the savings from doing the sleep time in parallel (as it will be when the sleep time is very short), the parallel program will be slower than the serial one. After this point, which appears to be between 10^-5 and 10^-4 seconds of sleep time, the parallel program becomes much faster than the serial one.
